        "summary": "We present an introduction to ab initio nuclear theory with a focus on\nnuclear reactions. After a high-level overview of ab initio approaches in\nnuclear physics, we give a more detailed description of the no-core shell model\ntechnique equivalent to a large extent to configuration-interaction methods\napplied in quantum chemistry. We then introduce the no-core shell model with\ncontinuum approach that provides a quantum many-body description of nuclear\nreactions. After a brief review of nuclear reactions important for\nastrophysics, we present examples of results of ab initio calculations of\nradiative capture and transfer reactions in light nuclei.",
